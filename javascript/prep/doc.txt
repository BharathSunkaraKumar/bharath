✅ JavaScript Interview Questions WITH Answers
⭐ Basic Level Answers
1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language used mainly to make web pages interactive.

2. Difference between var, let, and const
Keyword	Scope	Reassign	Hoisted	Notes
var	function scope	yes	yes (initialized as undefined)	Avoid using
let	block scope	yes	yes (no initialization → TDZ)	Preferred
const	block scope	no	yes (TDZ)	Value cannot be reassigned
3. What is hoisting?
Hoisting means variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.

var is hoisted with undefined.

let & const are hoisted but not initialized → Temporal Dead Zone.

Functions are fully hoisted.

4. Difference between == and ===
== → compares value only (performs type conversion).

=== → compares value + type (strict equality).

5. What is execution context?
It is the environment where JavaScript code runs.
Two types:

Global execution context

Function execution context

Each context has:

Memory creation phase

Execution phase

6. What is the call stack?
A stack where JavaScript stores the order of function execution.
It works on LIFO (Last in First Out).

7. Truthy and Falsy values
Falsy: 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, false
Everything else is truthy.

8. Function declaration vs function expression
Declaration → hoisted

Expression → not hoisted
Example:

function add() {}      // Declaration
const add = function() {}; // Expression
9. Arrow function differences
No this binding

Cannot be used as constructor

No arguments object

Shorter syntax

10. What is NaN?
NaN = Not a Number
Used when a mathematical operation fails.
Check using:

Number.isNaN(value);
⭐ Intermediate Level Answers
1. What are closures?
A closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after that outer function has returned.

2. What is the event loop?
The event loop continuously checks the call stack and callback/microtask queues, and pushes tasks from queues to the stack when it is empty.

3. Callback vs Promise vs Async/Await
Callback: Function passed inside another function.

Promise: Handles async operations with .then()

Async/Await: Cleaner way to handle promises.

4. What is this?
this refers to the object that is calling the function.

In arrow functions, this is taken from the parent scope (lexical).

5. What is prototype and prototypal inheritance?
Every JS object has a hidden [[Prototype]] object.
Objects can access properties/methods from their prototype → prototypal inheritance.

6. Higher-order functions
Functions that accept another function as argument or return a function.
Example: map, filter.

7. Debouncing vs Throttling
Debounce: Execute after user stops calling action (typing).

Throttle: Execute once every X ms (scroll event).

8. Event delegation
Attaching a single event listener to a parent to handle events from children → improves performance.

9. Shallow vs Deep copy
Shallow copy: Only copies top level (Object.assign, spread operator).

Deep copy: Copies nested values too (structuredClone(), JSON methods).

10. Spread vs Rest
// Spread
let arr2 = [...arr];

// Rest
function sum(...nums) {}
11. Difference between map, filter, reduce
map: transforms array

filter: returns matching items

reduce: returns a single value (sum, object, etc)

12. Sync vs Async code
Sync: executes line by line (blocking).

Async: does not block; uses callbacks/promises.

13. Callback hell
A situation of nested callbacks making code unreadable.
Solution: Promises & async/await.

14. What is fetch API?
A built-in method for making API calls. Returns a Promise.

15. Generator function
A function that can pause execution using yield.
Defined using function*.

⭐ Advanced Level Answers
1. Full flow of event loop
JS runs single-threaded on call stack

Web APIs handle async tasks

Microtask queue (Promises) runs before macrotask queue (setTimeout).

2. Memoization
Caching function results to improve performance.

3. How V8 engine works
Steps:

Parsing

Compilation (JIT)

Optimization

Execution

4. Garbage collection
JS uses mark and sweep algorithm → removes unreachable objects.

5. Currying
Converting a function with multiple arguments into chain of functions.
Example:

function sum(a)(b)(c)
6. Web APIs
Browser-provided APIs: DOM, fetch, timers, localStorage.

7. JS concurrency
JS is single-threaded but handles async tasks using event loop + callback queues.

8. freeze vs seal
Object.freeze: no add, delete, modify

Object.seal: cannot add/delete but can modify existing values

9. What happens when you use new?
Creates a new object, sets prototype, binds this, returns the object.

10. call, apply, bind
call → call with arguments

apply → call with array

bind → returns new function with bound this

11. Module pattern
Using IIFE to create private and public variables.

12. WeakMap & WeakSet
Hold weak references → not prevent garbage collection.

13. Event bubbling & capturing
Capturing: top → target

Bubbling: target → top

Default: bubbling.

14. Shadow DOM
Isolated DOM inside web components.

15. Design patterns in JS
Factory

Module

Singleton

Observer

Prototype
